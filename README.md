### Description
This web application uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the next value in a numerical sequence entered by the user. When a sequence like 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 is input, the model processes it and returns a predicted next valueâ€”in this case, 0.23771484. This output reflects the pattern the LSTM has learned from its training data, which may involve non-linear or time-dependent trends. Rather than simply continuing a linear progression, the prediction captures the temporal dynamics present in the dataset the model was trained on.
